The goal of this was to work in an existing code base and to create a controller for the pacman ghosts 
that would limit pacman to a certain score.
My work can be found by going controllers>studentcontroller. This file was created from scratch; 
I did not modify the other files.
Pacman score was limited greatly, this was considered a success.
